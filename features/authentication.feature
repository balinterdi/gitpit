  As a Pivotal Tracker user
  I want to authenticate myself

  Scenario: Log in through a form with a PT profile
    Given there is a PT profile with username: "veronica", password: "secret"
    When I go to the home page
    And I fill in "Username" with "veronica"
    And I fill in "Password" with "secret"
    And I press "Login"
    Then I should see a confirmation message
    And I should see "Welcome, veronica"
    But I should not see "Log in"

  Scenario: Failed login

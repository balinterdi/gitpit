// Feel free to delete these if you want keep the defaults:

$blueprint-grid-columns: 24;
$blueprint-container-size: 950px;
$blueprint-grid-margin: 10px;

// Content takes up the whole grid (minus prepend / append)
$content-columns: 22;
$sprite-default-size: 18px;

// Or you can set !blueprint_grid_width to a fixed value and unset !blueprint_container_size -- it will be calculated for you.
$blueprint-grid-width: ($blueprint-container-size + $blueprint-grid-margin) / $blueprint-grid-columns - $blueprint-grid-margin;
// $blueprint-grid-outer-width is the total with of a grid column
